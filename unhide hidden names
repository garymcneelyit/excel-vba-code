What the Code Does
Sub ShowNames(): Defines the start of a new macro named ShowNames.
Dim nmName As Name: Declares a variable nmName to hold each name object found in the workbook.
For Each nmName In ActiveWorkbook.Names: Loops through every defined name in the currently active Excel workbook.
nmName.Visible = True: Makes the current named range visible (unhides it).
Next nmName: Moves to the next name in the list.
End Sub: Ends the macro. 

Open the VBA editor (Alt + F11).
Insert a new module (Insert > Module).
Paste the code into the module.
Run the macro (F5 or the Play button) while your target workbook is active.
